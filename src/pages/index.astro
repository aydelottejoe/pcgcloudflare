			<h3>We Help You Make the Transition.</h3>

				We translate years of hard work into a clean, well-structured sale.

			<h2>The Automotive Industry’s Trusted Advisors</h2>
			<p>
				At Pleasanton Commercial Group, we understand that selling a business is one of the most significant financial 
				decisions of your life. It is not just a transaction; it is the culmination of years of hard work, late nights, 
				and dedication to your customers. Unlike generalist business brokers who sell everything from laundromats to tech 
				startups, PCG is hyper-focused on the automotive sector. We know the difference between a general repair shop, 
				a heavy-duty truck center, and a specialized collision facility. We understand how to value your assets—from 
				lifts and spray booths to the intangibles of your local reputation and recurring client base. Whether you are 
				looking to retire, relocate, or simply capitalize on your success, we bridge the gap between motivated sellers 
				and qualified buyers. Our process is designed to be seamless, profitable, and, most importantly, strictly confidential.
